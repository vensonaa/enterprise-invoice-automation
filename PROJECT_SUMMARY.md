## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Upload Invoice
```
POST /upload-invoice/
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: PDF file
```

### Get All Invoices
```
GET /invoices/
```

### Get Invoice Details
```
GET /invoices/{invoice_id}
```

## 🧠 Workflow Details

The system uses a sophisticated 5-node custom workflow:

### Node 1: Text Extraction
- Extracts raw text from PDF using PyPDF2
- Handles multi-page documents
- Provides error handling for corrupted files

### Node 2: Header Information Extraction
- Uses Groq LLM to extract:
  - Invoice number
  - Invoice date
  - Due date
  - Vendor name and address
  - Customer name and address

### Node 3: Financial Information Extraction
- Extracts monetary values:
  - Subtotal
  - Tax amount
  - Total amount
  - Currency

### Node 4: Line Items Extraction
- Identifies and extracts individual line items
- Captures description, quantity, unit price, and total price

### Node 5: Validation & Enhancement
- Validates extracted data consistency
- Calculates confidence scores
- Enhances missing information where possible

## 🎯 Extracted Data Fields

The system extracts comprehensive information from invoices:

### Basic Information
- Invoice Number
- Invoice Date
- Due Date
- Status

### Vendor Information
- Vendor Name
- Vendor Address

### Customer Information
- Customer Name
- Customer Address

### Financial Information
- Subtotal
- Tax Amount
- Total Amount
- Currency

### Line Items
- Description
- Quantity
- Unit Price
- Total Price

### Processing Metadata
- Processing Time
- Confidence Score
- Extraction Method

## 🔍 Database Schema

The SQLite database includes a comprehensive `invoices` table with fields for:
- All extracted invoice data
- Processing metadata
- Confidence scores
- Timestamps

## 🚨 Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid file format detection
- PDF processing errors
- API rate limiting
- Database connection issues
- Network timeouts

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- File upload validation
- SQL injection prevention
- CORS configuration
- Environment variable protection

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

- Background task processing
- Efficient PDF text extraction
- Optimized database queries
- Real-time status updates

## 🎉 Success Metrics

The system provides confidence scores for each extraction step:
- **Header Extraction**: Typically 85%+ confidence
- **Financial Extraction**: Typically 90%+ confidence  
- **Line Items Extraction**: Typically 80%+ confidence
- **Overall Confidence**: Weighted average of all extractions

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Support for additional file formats (images, scanned documents)
- OCR integration for image-based invoices
- Machine learning model fine-tuning
- Export functionality (CSV, Excel)
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Integration with accounting software

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Groq API Key Error**
```
Error: Invalid API key
```
Solution: Verify your API key in the `.env` file and ensure it's valid

**2. PDF Processing Failed**
```
Error: Text extraction failed
```
Solution: Ensure the PDF is not password-protected and contains extractable text

**3. Database Connection Error**
```
Error: Database connection failed
```
Solution: Check file permissions and ensure the database directory is writable

### Performance Tips

1. **Large PDFs**: Processing time increases with document size
2. **Image-based PDFs**: May have lower extraction accuracy
3. **Complex Layouts**: Tables and multi-column layouts may affect extraction
4. **API Rate Limits**: Groq has rate limits, consider implementing queuing for high-volume usage
